Spam Email Classifier is a simple yet effective web app built with Streamlit that uses machine learning to detect whether an email is spam or legitimate (ham). It leverages a trained Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF vectorization, and includes basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques like stopword removal and stemming.
